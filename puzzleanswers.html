      The Road Not Taken
      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
      and sorry that I could not travel both
      and be one traveler, long I stood
      and looked down one as far as I could
      to where it bent in the undergrowth;
      Then took the other as just as fair,
      and having perhaps the better claim
      because it was grassy and wanted wear;
      though as far that the passing there
      had worn them really about the same.
      And both that morning equally lay
      in leaves no step had trodded black.
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!
      Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
      I doubted if I should ever come back.
      I shall be telling this with a sigh
      somewhere ages and ages hence:
      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
      and I took the one less traveled by,
      and that has made all the difference.

      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
      Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
      And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
      Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
      And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
      And every fair from fair sometimes declines,
      By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;
      But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
      Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
      Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
      When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st.

      I AM TOO ALONE . . .

      I am too tiny in this world, and not tiny enough
          just to lie before you like a thing,
      shrewd and secretive.
      I want my own will, and I want simply to be with my will,
          as it goes toward action,
      and in the silent, sometimes hardly moving times
          when something is coming near,
      I want to be with those who know secret things
          or else alone.
      I want to be a mirror for your whole body,
          and I never want to be blind, or to be too old
      to hold up your heavy and swaying picture.
      I want to unfold.
      I don't want to stay folded anywhere,
      because where I am folded, there I am a lie.
      And I want my grasp of things
      true before you. I want to describe myself
      like a painting that I looked at
      closely for a long time,
      like a saying that I finally understood,
      like the pitcher I use every day,

      Welcome and entertain them all!

      One day you finally knew
      what you had to do, and began,
      though the voices around you
      kept shouting
      their bad advice-
      though the whole house
      began to tremble
      and you felt the old tug
      at your ankles.
      "Mend my life!"
      each voice cried.
      But you didn't stop.
      You knew what you had to do,
      though the wind pried
      with its stiff fingers
      at the very foundations,
      though their melancholy
      was terrible.
      It was already late
      enough, and a wild night,
      and the road full of fallen
      branches and stones.
      But little by little,
      as you left their voices behind,
      the stars began to burn
      through the sheets of clouds,
      and there was a new voice
      which you slowly recognized as your own,
      that kept you company
      as you strode deeper and deeper
      into the world,
      determined to do
      the only thing you could do-
      determined to save
      the only life you could save.

      When You Are Old

      When you are old and gray and full of sleep,
      And nodding by the fire, take down this book.
      And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
      Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep

      How many loved your moments of glad grace,
      And loved your beauty with love false or true;
      But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
      And loved the sorrows of your changing face.
      And bending down beside the glowing bars
      Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled
      And paced upon the mountains overhead
      And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

      The Song of a Man Who Has Come Through

      Not I, not I, but the wind that blows through me!
      A fine wind is blowing the new direction of Time.
      If only I let it bear me, carry me, if only it carry me!
      If only I am sensitive, subtle, oh, delicate, a winged gift!
      If only, Most lovely of all, I yield myself and am borrowed
      By the fine, fine wind that takes its course through the chaos of the world
      Like a fine, an exquisite chisel, a wedge-blade inserted;
      If only I am keen and hard like the sheer tip of a wedge
      Driven by invisible blows,
      The rock will split, we shall come at the wonder, we shall find the Hesperides.
      Oh for the wonder that bubbles into my soul,
      I would be a good fountain, a good well-head,
      Would blur no whisper, spoil no expression.

    My Shadow

     I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
     And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
     He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
     And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

     The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow -
     Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
     For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
     And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.
     He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
     And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
     He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;
     I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!
     One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
     I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
     But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
     Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.

      STOPPING BY WOODS ON A SNOWY EVENING

      Whose woods these are I think I know.
      His house is in the village, though
      He will not see me stopping here
      To watch his woods fill up with snow.
      My little horse must think it queer
      To stop without a farmhouse near
      Between the woods and frozen lake
      The darkest enening of the year.
      He gives his harness bells a shake
      To ask if there is some mistake.
      The only other sound's the sweep
      Of easy wind and downy flake.
      The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,
      But I have promises to keep,
      And miles to go before I sleep,
      And miles to go before I sleep.

      Warning

      When I am an old woman I shall wear purple
      With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.
      And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves
      And satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter.
      I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired
      And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells
      And run my stick along the public railings
      And make up for the sobriety of my youth.
      I shall go out in slippers in the rain
      And pick the flowers in other people's gardens
      And learn to spit.

      You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat
      And eat three pounds of sausages at a go
      Or only bread and pickle for a week
      And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.

      But now we must have clothes that keep us dry
      And pay our rent and not swear in the street
      And set a good example for the children.
      We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.

      But maybe I ought to practice a little now?
      So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised
      When suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple.

      IF

      If you can keep your head when all about you
      Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
      If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
      But make allowance for their doubting too;
      If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
      Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
      Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,
      And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;

      If you can dream- and not make dreams your master;
      If you can think- and not make thoughts your aim;
      If you can meet with triumph and disaster
      And treat those two impostors just the same;
      If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
      Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
      Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
      And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;

      If you can make one heap of all your winnings
      And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
      And lose, and start again at your beginnings
      And never breathe a word about your loss;
      If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
      To serve your turn long after they are gone,
      And so hold on when there is nothing in you
      Except the Will which says to them; "Hold on";

      If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
      Or walk with kings- nor lose the common touch;
      If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
      If all men count with you, but none too much;
      If you can fill the unforgiving minute
      With sixty seconds' worth of distance run-
      Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
      And- which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

      The New Rule

      It's the old rule that drunks have to argue
      and get into fights.
      The lover is just as bad. He falls into a hole.
      But down in that hole he finds something shining,
      worth more than any amount of money or power.

      Last night the moon came dropping its clothes in the street.
      I took it as a sign to start singing,
      falling up into the bowl of sky.
      The bowl breaks. Everywhere is falling everywhere.
      Nothing else to do.
      Here's the new rule: break the wineglass,
      and fall toward the glassblower's breath.

      YOUR CHILDREN

      A woman who held a babe against
      her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.
     	And he said:
     	Your children are not your children.
         They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
     They come through you but not from you,
     	And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
     	You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
     	For they have their own thoughts.
     	You may house their bodies but not their souls,
     	For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit,
      not even in your dreams.
     	You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
     	For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
     	You are the bows from which your children as living arrows
         are sent forth.
     	The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you
      with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
     	Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;
     	For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so he loves
      also the bow that is stable.

      When Death Comes

      When death comes
      like the hungry bear in autumn;
      when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse

      to buy me, and snaps the purse shut;
      when death comes
      like the measle-pox;
      when death comes
      like an iceberg between the shoulder blades,
      I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering:
      what is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?
      And therefore I look upon everything
      as a brotherhood and a sisterhood,
      and I look upon time as no more than an idea,
      and I consider eternity as another possibility,
      and I think of each life as a flower, as common
      as a field daisy, and as singular,

      and each name a comfortable music in the mouth,
      tending, as all music does, toward silence,
      and each body a lion of courage, and something
      precious to the earth.
      When it's over, I want to say: all my life
      I was a bride married to amazement,
      I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.
      When it's over, I don't want to wonder
      if I have made of my life something particular, and real.
      I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,
      or full of argument.
      I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.

      The Seaside
